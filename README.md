JBytedit aims for easy code inspection and manipulation, no matter in which JVM based language it is coded.

It comes with an easy-to-use and stable environment as well as a range of advantages over it's competitors, such as full ASM integration, which makes saving and bytecode manipulation a whole lot versatile, ZKM string deobfuscation and much more.  

JBytedit is coded in Kotlin, the new hope for JVM-based languages, which handles a lot of common problems in a innovative manner.
